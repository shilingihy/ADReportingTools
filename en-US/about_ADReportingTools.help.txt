SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The commands in the ADReportingTools module are designed to be easy to use,
    and to get commonly requested or useful information from Active Directory.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The Active Directory module from Microsoft is a useful tool. However, it
    requires a bit of effort to get the information you might want to see in the
    proper form. The commands in this module are designed, as the module name
    implies, as reporting tools. Many of the commands have custom default
    formatting to present the information in an easy-to-read format. Although,
    you can also export or convert the output.

    Some of the commands present information to the screen using ANSI escape
    sequences. You must run the command in a console or terminal that supports
    this feature. The PowerShell ISE does not.

    The commands focus primarily on Active Directory users, groups, and
    computers.
