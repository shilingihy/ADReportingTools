# Module Functions

This section contains the same help content you would get from a PowerShell prompt using `Get-Help`. Note that most code examples have been formatted to fit the 80 character page width and sometimes with artificial formatting. Don't assume you can run examples _exactly_ as they are shown. Some of the help examples might also use special or custom characters that might not render properly in the PDF.

If you can't remember what commands are in this module, you can always ask PowerShell.

```powershell
Get-Command -module ADReportingTools
```

Or use the `Get-PSScriptTools` command.
