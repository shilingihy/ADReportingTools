# Introduction

This manual is a PDF version of several module-related reference files as well as all of the command help. The goal is to provide a single source for all module documentation.Many of the source files contain internal cross-references. Best efforts have been made to port those links to this document, but a few links may fail to open. External links should work as expected.

If you need to ask a question or report a problem, please visit the module's [Github repository](https://github.com/jdhitsolutions/ADReportingTools).
